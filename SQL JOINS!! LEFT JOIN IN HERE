###For Dav1d at Dexagon, I have been brushing up on my SQL joins, and more :)


### Demonstration of joins in SQL, starting with a left join example.

SELECT Department.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Department
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Department.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Department.CustomerName;

### the inner join

SELECT Department.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Department
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Department.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Department.CustomerName;

### the right join

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Agents.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Agents
ON Orders.EmployeeID=Agents.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;

### Full outer

SELECT Dept.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Dept
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
ON Dept.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Dept.CustomerName;
